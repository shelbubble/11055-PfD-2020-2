/* 

Object oreintation lets you create objects that hold state over time.

It starts as a similar concept to arrays that you have a variable with many variables inside.
But it is much more than that.

// NOTE the use of 'this' keyword - it always refers to the properties of the object it belongs to


// then you can call it - see how it looks the same as document.write()...
document.write(car3.startcar() + "<br/>")

// also try this to see inside the function...
document.write(car3.startcar + "<br/>")

document.write(document.write)
