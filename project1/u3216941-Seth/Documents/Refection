Refection 
The task for project 1 was  to create a self-portrait using basic programming knowledge 
learnt up to now and to use the p5.js library. At the Start of the project, I had trouble figuring
out how I would create the face, but after I started work on it  I slowly figure out what to do. The final version 
of my self-portrait end of looking quite good with some interactive parts added to it. The parts that could have a bit 
more work done to it would be the eyes, mouth and ears but with the timeframe I had I believe  the face turn out quite well.
This project has expanded my knowledge on JavaScript and the uses of the p5 library. I used some of the skills learnt throughout
the semester from the tutorial and lecture to complete this project. I believe my project end up with a good result 
but could have been better in some areas.
